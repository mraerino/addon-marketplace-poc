#### Build apps fast, without managing infrastructure

Firebase gives you functionality like analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting so you can move quickly and focus on your users.

#### Backed by Google, trusted by top apps

Firebase is built on Google infrastructure and scales automatically, for even the largest apps.

#### One platform, with products that work better together

Firebase products work great individually but share data and insights, so they work even better together.
